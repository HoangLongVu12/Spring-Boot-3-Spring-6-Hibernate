Sample of the reviews:

Best Spring Boot course by far across all learning platforms for me. Best course structure and instructor always demonstrates in depth knowledge by covering the necessary basics. Really really incredible good presentation and structure, a lot of other instructors can learn a lot from you Chad. - Muzi P.



I worked in some company, so I can say that this course is 100% industry oriented. The best course for learning Spring Framework. Getting replies within 24 hours. - Premang



I'm adding to my review following Chad's recent updates to his course to cover Spring Boot, JPA, etc. After finishing the course originally, I found another Spring Boot class, and after working on this other class, I appreciate more what Chad has done here. He's made Spring Boot for CRUD applications with Thymeleaf very easy to follow and learn. I've taken half a dozen other software courses, and while other instructors might be good, Chad is the gold standard here. I can't recommend him highly enough. - Dave Zeltserman



This is the best tutorial I've seen so far for Spring/Hibernate, each step is well explained and the tutorial videos are made to a high standard. I highly recommend this course! - Rob



Hats off to you Chad, the best Spring fundamentals course I have done on Udemy thus far. You never disappoint. - Morebodi Modise

What Is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is the modern development approach for building enterprise application. Spring Boot minimizes the configuration required for setting up Spring projects. By using Spring Boot, you can accelerate your development speed and leverage the auto-configuration features. This course covers the latest version of Spring Boot 3.



What Is Spring?

Spring is an enterprise Java framework. It was designed to simplify Jakarta EE development and make developers more productive. Spring makes use of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection to promote good software coding practices and speed up development time. This course covers the latest version of Spring 6.

This course covers Spring Core, Annotations, All Java Spring Configuration, Spring AOP, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring REST, Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA.



What Is Hibernate/JPA?

Hibernate/JPA is an Object-to-Relational-Mapping (ORM) framework. It simplifies database access for Java applications. By using the framework, you can easily store and retrieve Java objects by setting up some simple configuration mappings.

This course covers basic Hibernate/JPA CRUD. Also, advanced Hibernate/JPA mappings are covered for one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many.



Benefits of Taking This Spring Boot and Hibernate Course

Knowing Spring Boot and Hibernate can get you a job or improve the one you have. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the enterprise Java industry, and make your software life easier, that's why it's so popular.

Nearly every job posting asks for skills in Spring Boot and Hibernate!

This course will help you quickly get up to speed with Spring Boot and Hibernate. I will demystify the technology and help you understand the essential concepts to build a real Spring Boot and Hibernate application from scratch.

Compared to other Spring Boot/Hibernate courses

This course is fully up to date and covers the latest versions of Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 and Hibernate 6. The course also includes new content on Spring Boot 3, Spring Data JPA, Spring Data REST and Thymeleaf.

Beware of other Udemy Spring/Hibernate courses. Most of them are outdated and use old versions of Spring and Hibernate. Don’t waste your time or money on learning outdated technology.

Also, I create all of the code from scratch in this course. Beware of other courses, those instructors simply copy/paste from their github repo or they use pre-written code. Their approach is not ideal for real-time learning.

Take my course where I show you how to create all of the code from scratch. You can type the code along with me in the videos, which is the best way to learn.

I am a very responsive instructor and I am available to answer your questions and help you work through any problems.

Finally, all source code is provided with the course along with setup instructions.
